<h2>MUSIC FOR KOKO'S HEART</h2>
<p>
	While working on the first record -  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ctcamels/albums" target="_blank">8</a> ( CTcamels) KOKO's path crossed with producer Roy Avni it was love at first sight. <br/><br/>
They could not postpone gratifications recorded a second record considering the reality of no funds, it was decided to record a song on the day - it is possible.<br/><br/>
But with this passion twins were born and drove them as far as Ein Gev in the north to the concert hall to record the third record.<br/><br/>
Both will be released this year (2020).<br/><br/>
The albums are l in English, indie rock. A bit psychedelic, a bit classic, and sometimes even glam.  The album draws its contents from the mental illnesses of modern society (and ours) and the constant need for innovation and immediate thrills.<br/><br/>
During the recordings, wonderful artists came to the studio and poured into the records what without them could not have been like me and Roy dreamed and I could not let them go and we continue on stage.<br/><Hr/>
